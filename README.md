Created an automated recipe bot involves building a web application that enables users to search for recipes based on specified ingredients
The project consists of a frontend developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a user-friendly interface where users can input ingredients and view recipe results.
The backend is powered by Node.js, which handles server-side logic, including routing and API requests. The application integrates with a third-party recipe API, such as Spoonacular, 
to fetch relevant recipes based on user input. When a user submits an ingredient, the frontend sends a request to the backend server, which then queries the recipe API and returns
a list of recipes.
These recipes are then dynamically displayed on the webpage. The project setup includes creating a project structure with separate directories for the frontend and backend code,
setting up the necessary dependencies, and configuring environment variables to securely manage API keys.
The application is designed to be simple yet extensible, allowing for future enhancements such as advanced search options, user authentication, and personalized recipe r
ecommendations.
